![Project Image](https://github.com/BorisSobreiraPaleo/Personal-Website/blob/main/src/assets/images/projects/timelapseGenerator.png?raw=true)

## Description üìë

This script optimizes the process of accelerating and merging video files sourced from a designated directory, utilizing the robust capabilities of FFmpeg software. It enables the creation of a customized timelapse video, tailored to the user's desired duration.

## What have I learned in this project? üß†

This script arises from the necessity to automate a procedure I conduct weekly. It involves condensing my training videos to conserve disk space without sacrificing relevant information. This circumvents the tedious task of manually editing videos and adjusting each one before exporting.

In implementing this script, I discovered the potential of software such as FFmpeg and its commands, as well as the efficient management of tools like CMD and PowerShell for script development. Additionally, I gained proficiency in utilizing mathematical functions, such as handling decimals and rounding, alongside skills in directory management and video editing, including manipulation of frame rates and file formats.
